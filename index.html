<h1>What Is Correlation Used For?</h1>
<p>Correlation can be defined as a way to observe simialrities between two different ideas. In order to use Correlation however, you must 1. Use two quantitative variables and 2. They must be similar in their purpose. One good example of this could be something like Ice-Cream Sales compared with Temperature Outside. We can see a correlation between higher temperatures and higher sales of Ice-Cream, however we must remember that Correlation is <b>NOT</b> Causation.</p>
<h1>Correlation V.S. Causation</h1>
<p>Correlation is something that can be assumed that just happen at the same time, a common example that I know of is the Increase of Murders in Summer as well as Ice-Cream Sales increasing in the Summer. Even though these both increase at the same time, does that mean Ice-Cream Sales <b>CAUSE</b> More Murders? NO! This is just a coincidence, while they may be correlated, they are not the cause of one another.
